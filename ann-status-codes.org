* [[https://github.com/neotyk/status-codes][*status-codes*]] is easy response status codes
  It's easy status codes for compojure.
  Not that status codes in compojure are particularly hard.
  I just prefer in applications that I work with to use keywords for
  status codes, rather than status codes as numbers.
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  (routes
   (GET "/ok"           _ :ok)
   (GET "/accepted"     _ :accepted)
   (GET "/ok-map"       _ {:status :ok})
   (GET "/accepted-map" _ {:status :accepted}))
#+END_SRC
  Not much really, but it reads better than 200, 202 and so on.
  In order to have this sugar in your routes pick status-codes from
  [[http://clojars.org/status-codes][clojars]], and require/use status-codes:
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  (ns your.ns
    (:use status-codes))
#+END_SRC
  Enjoy.
