    <h3><a href="TODO">*print-length*</a> and why it affects <a href="http://bit.ly/68DPP7">clojure.core/str</a></h3>
    <div>While having fun with <a href="TODO">swank.core/break</a> I managed to "freeze" it.<br />
      As it <a href="TODO link to bug report">turns out</a> issue was that <a href="http://bit.ly/68DPP7">clojure.core/str</a>
      tried to realize infinite sequence, to print locals. Even if you don't know what it means you must agree that it doesn't sound like a good
      idea with finite resources available.<br />
      I remebered that you could limit number of items printed, <a href="TODO">Duck Duck Go</a> it and <b>*print-length*</b> showed up.<br />
      This is cool but it is for printing, isn't it?</div>
    <TODO>Make it to gist:
      user=> (str '(1 2))
      "(1 2)"</TODO>
    But look at that:
    <TODO gist>
      user=> (binding [*print-length* 1] (str '(1 2)))
      "(1 ...)"</TODO>
    Alright, this is good news, this means that fix will be <a href="TODO link to patch">simple</a>, but on the other hand, why it worked?<br />
    Documentation says following:
    <TODO gist>
      user=> (doc str)
      -------------------------
      clojure.core/str
      ([] [x] [x & ys])
      With no args, returns the empty string. With one arg x, returns
      x.toString().  (str nil) returns the empty string. With more than
      one arg, returns the concatenation of the str values of the args.
      nil</TODO>
    It doesn't look to me like it should honor <b>*print-length*</b>. Same in <a href="source of str">source code</a>, it doesn't realy tell why it works.<br />
    This was certainly a time to consult global Clojure brain, thanks to <TODO>list guys that helped</TODO> mystery was solved.<br />
    <h3>And the reason is</h3>
    <div>What happens when you call <code>(str '(1 2))</code>?
      TODO Finish.
