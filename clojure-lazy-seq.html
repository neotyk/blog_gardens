    <h3><a href="LINK lazy-seq source">clojure.core/lazy-seq</a> makes sense</h3>
    <div>Yesterday on #clojure TODO(someone) asked about <a href="LINK to infamous wiki">infamous wiki entry</a>.<br/>
      I remember that while a go, when I tried to understand <a href="LINK to clojure lazynes">lazynes</a> in Clojure
      I stumbled upon this entry as well, and it caused only confusion, as it is totaly outdated.</div>
    <h3>Not lazy seq</h3>
    <div>When you construct a seq in non lazy way you should expect that all elements are realised at creation time.<br/>
      <code>
	(let [a (cons 1 (cons 2 nil))] (first a))
	=> 1
      </code>
      Nothing special here. Lets introduce side effects to see what happens.
      <code>
	(let [a (cons (do (println "one") 1) (cons (do (println "two") 2) nil))] (first a))
	: one
	: two
	=> 1
      </code>
      As you expected all elements has been realised while constructing "a", though we only needed first element.
      And that's exeactly where lazynes kicks in.</div>
    <h3>lazy-seq</h3>
    <div>First lets construct lazy seq with no side effects.<br/>
      <code>
	(let [a (lazy-seq (cons 1 (lazy-seq (cons 2 nil))))] (first a))
	=> 1
      </code>
      So what is new? You have to type more and effect is the same. Why?<br/>
      Adding side effects will help undertand it.<br/>
      <code>
	(let [a (lazy-seq (cons (do (println "one") 1) (lazy-seq (cons (do (println "two") 2) nil))))] (first a))
	: one
	=> 1
      </code>
      Now you should be able to see the benefit. Result is the same, except not whole sequence has been realized,
      only first element, as it was only element that was requested.<br/>
      That is very powerful tool, you can construct infinite sequences, have side effects create elemets "on demand".
      TODO other bennefits of lazynes.</div>
    <h3>Extreme case</h3>
    <div>Not that would make much sense in real application but will show why you will enjoy lazynes in Clojure.<br/>
      <code>
	(let [a (cons (do (println "one") 1) (cons (do (println "two") 2) nil))])
	: one
	: two
	=> nil
      </code>
      We didn't need even single element but whole seq was realized.
      <code>
	(let [a (lazy-seq (cons (do (println "one") 1) (lazy-seq (cons (do (println "two") 2) nil))))])
	=> nil
      </code>
      If not even a single element is needed, than not even single element will be realized.<br/>
      Hope it helped you understanding what is lazynes in Clojure and what are it's benefits.
