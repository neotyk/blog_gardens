    <h3><a href="http://bit.ly/dsPqd5">clojure.core/lazy-seq</a> makes sense</h3> 
    <div>Few days ago on #clojure <a href="http://bit.ly/93h5iI">bartj</a> asked about <a href="http://bit.ly/9zzBg0">an infamous wiki entry</a>.<br/> 
      I remember that while ago, when I tried to understand <a href="http://bit.ly/buja8y">laziness</a> in Clojure
      I stumbled upon this entry as well, and it caused me only confusion, as it is totally outdated.<br/> 
      Let's try to shed some light on it.</div> 
    <h3>Not lazy seq</h3> 
    <div>When you construct a seq in non lazy way you should expect that all elements are realized at creation time.<br/> 
      <pre><code>(let [a (cons 1 (cons 2 nil))] (first a))
<span class="result">=> 1</span></code></pre> 
      Nothing special here. Let's introduce side effects to see what happens.
      <pre><code>(let [a (cons
	 (do (println "one") 1)
	 (cons
	  (do (println "two") 2)
	  nil))]
  (first a))
<span class="stdout">: one
: two</span> 
<span class="result">=> 1</span></code></pre> 
      As you expected all elements has been realized while constructing <code>a</code>, though we only needed the first element.<br/> 
      And that's exactly where laziness kicks in.</div> 
    <h3>lazy-seq</h3> 
    <div>First lets construct lazy seq with no side effects.<br/> 
      <pre><code>(let [a (lazy-seq (cons 1
	           (lazy-seq (cons 2 nil))))]
  (first a))
<span class="result">=> 1</span></code></pre> 
      So what is new? You have to type more and effect is the same. Why?<br/> 
      Adding side effects will help understanding it.<br/> 
      <pre><code>(let [a (lazy-seq (cons
	           (do (println "one") 1)
	           (lazy-seq (cons
	                      (do (println "two") 2) nil))))]
  (first a))
<span class="stdout">: one</span> 
<span class="result">=> 1</span></code></pre> 
      Now you should be able to see the benefit. Result is the same, except the whole sequence hasn't been realized,<br/> 
      except for the first element, as it was the only element that was needed.<br/> 
      Laziness is a very powerful tool:
      <ul> 
	<li>you can construct infinite sequences,</li> 
	<li>have side effects create elements <em>on demand</em>, if seq construction is heavy, you might want to only issue creation of elements you'll use,</li> 
	<li>it has same interface as non-lazy seq, code using it does not have to care about it.</li> 
      </ul> 
    </div> 
    <h3>To sum it up</h3> 
    <div>
      <pre><code>(let [a (cons
	 (do (println "one") 1)
	 (cons
	  (do (println "two") 2) nil))])
<span class="stdout">: one
: two</span> 
<span class="result">=> nil</span></code></pre> 
      We didn't need even single element but the whole seq was realized.
      <pre><code>(let [a (lazy-seq (cons
	           (do (println "one") 1)
	           (lazy-seq (cons
                              (do (println "two") 2) nil))))])
<span class="result">=> nil</span></code></pre> 
      If not even a single element is needed, than not even a single element will be realized.<br/> 
      So there you have it <a href="http://bit.ly/dsPqd5"><em>clojure.core/lazy-seq</em></a> explained.
